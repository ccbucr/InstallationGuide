**ESRI Platform Software**

- ESRI ArcGIS Desktop: a proprietary desktop GIS software suite that allows you to create maps, perform spatial analysis and manage data. Required software for installation: Microsoft .NET (aka a PC machine), Python 2.7+. 
- ESRI ArcGIS Pro: ArcGIS Desktop is transitioning to ArcGIS Pro, an interactive spatial data visualization tool that allows users to create 2D maps, 3D scenes, and share projects on ArcGIS Online. Training resources for ArcGIS Pro are [here](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/resources).
- ESRI ArcGIS Online: This is cloud-based software that runs on any device with an internet connection. It allows users to easily publish maps on-line, access other UCR spatial products, and create spatial data dashboards and hubs.
