## UCR VPN - GlobalProtect

UC Riverside provides free access to a Virtual Private Network (VPN), GlobalProtect, that allows you to access the CCB NAS Server or campus resources (ex: library services) when working remotely.

To install and use the GlobalProtect VPN, navigate to the UCR ServiceLink [GlobalProtect Connection Installation Instructions](https://ucrsupport.service-now.com/ucr_portal/?id=kb_article&sys_id=8a264d791b5f0c149c0b844fdd4bcb34).

## CCB NAS Server

The Center for Conservation Biology has a NAS Server, which serves as the primary data storage location to access data and reference files. CCB staff should ensure that all work and research related files are saved on the NAS. Reference **Chapter** \@ref(organization) for proper directory organization and file naming. 

Network-attached storage (NAS) is dedicated file storage that enables multiple users to retrieve data from centralized disk capacity. The purpose of NAS is to enable users to collaborate and share data more effectively. It is especially useful to teams that need remote access. NAS connects to a wireless router, making it easy for remote workers to access files from any device with a network connection. 

The CCB NAS server model is Synology DS920+. For more information on the unit, see **Chapter** \@ref(equipment).

In order to access the CCB NAS, there just a few steps: 

- **Step 01:** Request the creation of a NAS user account through the designated CCB staff member. You will need to provide your preferred **username** (typically similar to UCR ID) and a **passcode**. The passcode must be a strong code: a unique code with 12 - 15 characters consisting of a mix of letters, numbers, symbols, and does not contain personal information. 

- **Step 02:** Once a user account has been created, log onto the UCR VPN (*see above section*).

- **Step 03:** Map the server onto your local computer: 
  - For PCs running Windows 11: 
    1. Open File Explorer on Windows 11.
    2. Click on `This PC` from the left pane.
    3. Click the `See More` (three-dotted) button in the command bar and select the “Map network drive” option.
```{r nasmap, echo = F, auto_pdf = TRUE, fig.align = 'left', fig.height = 3, fig.alt="Screen shot of PC file path to map network drive."}

knitr::include_graphics("images/nas_map.png")
```
    4. Use the `Drive` drop-down menu and choose a letter to assign the drive.
    5. In the `Folder` field, enter the network path to the shared folder, `\\CCBNAS.dyn.ucr.edu\pdo`. (Or click the Browse button to browse the folder to map as a network drive, and click the OK button.)
```{r naspath, echo = F, auto_pdf = TRUE, fig.align = 'left', fig.height = 3}

knitr::include_graphics("images/nas_path.png")
```
    6. Check the `Reconnect at sign-in` option to make the connection permanent.
    7. Check the Connect using different credentials option if the credentials are different from the account you are already using.
    8. Click the Finish button.
    9. Confirm the network account credentials (if applicable) to map the network drive to Windows 11.
    10. Click the OK button.
    
Once you complete the steps, the network drive will become available in File Explorer.

If you run into issues, first read over this [blog post for a common linkage issue](https://www.robertwent.com/blog/mapping-a-synology-nas-drive-in-windows-11/).
    
  
  - For PCs running Windows 10: 
    1. On your Windows 10 PC, open Windows Explorer.
    2. Click on This Computer.
    3. Click on Map network drive.
```{r nasmap10, echo = F, auto_pdf = TRUE, fig.align = 'left', fig.height = 3}

knitr::include_graphics("images/nas_map10.png")
```
    4. Select a drive letter from the drop-down menu.
    5. Enter  `\\CCBNAS.dyn.ucr.edu\pdo` into the folder field.
    6. Click Finish.
    7. Enter your Synology NAS username and password in the Windows credentials pop-up prompt.
    
The mapped network drive will now appear within Windows Explorer as local storage, allowing you to quickly transfer files.
  
  - For Macs: 
    1. Open the Finder app.
    2. Click `Go` on top bar and select `Connect to Server`.
    3. Type in the CCB NAS IP: `smb://CCBNAS.dyn.ucr.edu/pdo`
    4. Enter `User Name` and `Passcode`.
    
There should be a connection set to the CCB NAS at the folder level.

```{r nasmac, echo = F, auto_pdf = TRUE, fig.align = 'left', fig.height = 3}

knitr::include_graphics("images/nas_mac.png")
```


## Google Apps

The CCB team utilizes a number of Google applications for project management, data & file sharing, and communicating with colleagues. 

**Google Calendar:** There is a lab Google calendar, *UCR CCB Palm Desert*. This calendar maintains lab mates work and leave schedules as well as any team meetings. Please make sure this calendar is shared with you once you have obtained your UCR NetId. 

**Google Drive:** CCB utilizes *Shared Drive* folders as a file sharing application. You must request access to the shared drive folder from the lab P.I. 

**Google Sites:** There is a [CCB Google Site](https://sites.google.com/ucr.edu/ccbucr/home) that is in draft form at the moment. This site may serve as an intranet or provide public facing information in the future. 

## Microsoft 360 Suite

Zoom is a great tool to schedule virtual meetings, and the CCB hosts Zoom-based team meeting regularly. UC Riverside provides all faculty, staff, and students a free premium account. In order to utilize this service, download the application and sign in via Single Sign-ON (SS0). For the most current installation and log in information, visit UC Riverside's [Information Technology Systems Zoom account page](https://its.ucr.edu/blog/2019/12/17/changes-ucr-zoom-account-access).

- **Step 1**: Download the Zoom application via [UC Riverside's Zoom service page](https://ucr.zoom.us/) - just select the **Download** button!

```{r zoomdownload, echo = F, auto_pdf = TRUE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 2, fig.alt="Image of UC Riverside's Zoom Service page that has 4 buttons that prompts users to either Sign In, Sign In, Download, Join, Host."}

knitr::include_graphics("images/zoomdownload.png")
```
