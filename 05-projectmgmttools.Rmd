# Project Management Tools {#projmgmt}

## Google Apps

The CCB team utilizes a number of Google applications for project management, data & file sharing, and communicating with colleagues. 

**Google Calendar:** There is a lab Google calendar, *UCR CCB Palm Desert*. This calendar maintains lab mates work and leave schedules as well as any team meetings. Please make sure this calendar is shared with you once you have obtained your UCR NetId. 

**Google Drive:** CCB utilizes *Shared Drive* folders as a file sharing application. You must request access to the shared drive folder from the lab P.I. 

**Google Sites:** There is a [CCB Google Site](https://sites.google.com/ucr.edu/ccbucr/home) that is in draft form at the moment. This site may serve as an intranet or provide public facing information in the future. If you would like edit access, please submit a request to the CCB PI.

## Zotero

The Center for Conservation Biology shares research references through Zotero software. Zotero is a citation management tool and allows groups to collect and share references easily. The Zotero browser extension makes it easy to copy citations from webpages. 

To install Zotero and the extension, please follow UC Riverside's installation instructions [here](https://guides.lib.ucr.edu/c.php?g=171064). *Note*: These instructions are for a **Windows** machine, but it is a similar process for Macs. 

```{r zotero, echo = F, auto_pdf = TRUE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 6}

knitr::include_graphics("images/zoteroinstall.png")
```


```{r zoteroextension, echo = F, auto_pdf = TRUE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 6}

knitr::include_graphics("images/zoteroextension.png")
```

The next step is to create a Zotero account and enable syncing to enable extension use and to be able to join the [CCB Zotero Reference Group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4734848/ccbucr). Make sure to use your using the UCR email address when setting up the Zotero account. 

```{r zoterosyncing, echo = F, auto_pdf = TRUE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 6}

knitr::include_graphics("images/zoterosyncing.png")
```

To connect to the CCB Zotero Reference Group, navigate to [this link](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4734848/ccbucr). If you do not have access to the Group page, please send a request that you be added to the CCB PI.

## Zoom

Zoom is a great tool to schedule virtual meetings, and the CCB hosts Zoom-based team meeting regularly. UC Riverside provides all faculty, staff, and students a free premium account. In order to utilize this service, download the application and sign in via Single Sign-ON (SS0). For the most current installation and log in information, visit UC Riverside's [Information Technology Systems Zoom account page](https://its.ucr.edu/blog/2019/12/17/changes-ucr-zoom-account-access).

- **Step 1**: Download the Zoom application via [UC Riverside's Zoom service page](https://ucr.zoom.us/) - just select the **Download** button!

```{r zoomdownload, echo = F, auto_pdf = TRUE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 2, fig.alt="Image of UC Riverside's Zoom Service page that has 4 buttons that prompts users to either Sign In, Sign In, Download, Join, Host."}

knitr::include_graphics("images/zoomdownload.png")
```


- **Step 2**: Once the application is downloading, Zoom will automatically open. You will be prompted to either *Join a Meeting* or *Sign In*. Select *Sign In* and set up your UCR Zoom account using your NetId information. 

- **Step 3**: Click the *Sign In with SSO* button, then enter `ucr` in the *company domain* section. 

```{r sso, echo = F, auto_pdf = TRUE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 2, fig.alt="Image of Zoom Account Sign In prompt displaying 4 buttons: SSO, Apple, Google, Facebook"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/zoomsso.png")
```

```{r domain, echo = F, auto_pdf = TRUE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 2}

knitr::include_graphics("images/zoomdomain.png")
```

- **Step 4**: You will then be prompted to sign in, this time using your UCR NetId. The program may open up an authentication window requesting your UCR NetId as shown below:

```{r zoomcred, echo = F, auto_pdf = TRUE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 2}

knitr::include_graphics("images/zoomcred.png")
```

- **Step 5**: Personalize your Zoom account! You can add your name, pronouns, and an image to your profile, create a *personal Zoom room* to utilize as a default meeting space, and set settings like *mute all participants when they join a meeting* or turn off settings such as *start meetings with participant video on. Participants can change this during the meeting.*

Happy Zooming!
