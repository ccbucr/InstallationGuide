For more information, please visit What is R. To install R, visit cloud.r-project.org to download the most recent version for your operating system. Would you like a visual guide for install R and R Studio? Check out this YouTube R for Ecologist 2.1.1 Updating R If you already have R installed, you may want to update the version of R you are using. Usually this occurs with a major version upgrades versus minor updates. Please be aware that when you update R, it means re-installing all of the packages you have previously installed. It is worth updating R when major updates are released, especially if new packages you are attempting to install are not compatible with the version of R currently installed. In order to update R, you have to find your installed version of R and run it on its own, outside of RStudio. This is easy if you have an R desktop shortcut, but not too hard if you hunt around a bit in your Applications folder. Please see details below in Section 2.1.2 to save all R packages currently installed PRIOR to updating R, so you won’t have to reinstall them individually after the update Double click the R icon to start up R. It will open the R Console and a menu. Click on the R menu at top left, and select Check for R Updates. If you are up to date, the R Console will report “Your version of R is up to date”. If not, this process will provide windows and buttons to click to upgrade to the latest version of R. When done, quit R and start RStudio to make sure the update has carried over. You should see the new version number when RStudio starts. 2.1.2 Bulk Save R Packages Prior to Updates In order to follow the bulk save R package instructions, you will need to have R Studio installed, and be familiar with the terminal and console panels.** Before updating R, check out where your current package library is saved by entering .libPaths() in the console of RStudio. This should look something like: [1] \"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2/Resources/library\" Note that this package library is specific to the most recent major and minor version of R. If you upgrade from 4.1.x to 4.2.x, you will have a new library path to a new 4.2 folder, and will need to re-install packages in this folder. You can do this from scratch, and install packages individually as needed (which is not a bad way to clean out packages you are not using), but you may prefer to re-install all packages in an organized way, rather than when you need to use one You can see a dataframe of all currently installed packages by running the base R function installed.packages() in the R Studio console. This will help make a list of packages prior to updating R. There is also a package for Windows, {installr}, which will pull the list of your current packages and install these in the correct folder for the new version of R. If you are on a Windows OS, and have installed the {installr} package, the installr::updateR() command in the console performs the following: finding the latest R version downloading it running the installer deleting the installation file copy old packages to the new R installation updating old packages as needed for the new R installation But for MacOS and UnixOS folks, this must be done manually. 2.1.2.1 Saving a List of R Packages Manually The short script below will save a vector of your current packages to a file in your root (home) directory, named installed.packages.rda. Copy this code chunk below into your Console pane in RStudio and run it. Then reopen RStudio, go to the Files tab, click on Home , and check your root (home) directory for the installed.packages.rda file. You can click on this file to load it into your Environment tab (answer yes to load). In your Environment tab, it should look like a character vector with the names of all of your packages in quotes. # save list to tmp as a matrix object tmp = installed.packages() # filter for all rows where the &#39;Priority&#39; column is NA, # and select just (column 1) the package names in quotes, # and then assign this vector to the installedpackages # object installedpackages = as.vector(tmp[is.na(tmp[, &quot;Priority&quot;]), 1]) # save this vector as an *.rda file in your root (home) # directory save(installedpackages, file = &quot;~/installed_packages.rda&quot;) # remove the tmp matrix and the installedpackages vector # from your Environment rm(tmp) rm(installedpackages) Now that you have your saved list of packages stored in a file, you are ready to upgrade R. Quit RStudio, and go to r-project.org. 2.1.2.2 Reinstalling list of R Packages First, let’s check your new R version with R.Version() - run this in the Console pane. This should be the new version. Now let’s check your library path with .libPaths() - run this in the Console Pane - this should match your R version. Now run installed.packages(). This should show that your new library is mostly empty, except for the base R packages. We will now fix that. Now you need to take advantage of your nicely-stored list of packages to reinstall all of your packages in your new (mostly empty) library. Use the short script below to load the file installed.packages.rda to open a vector of your previous packages in your Environment pane, and then re-install all of these packages. Copy the code chunk below into your Console pane in RStudio and run it. This will take a while, especially if you have a lot of packages installed. While you are waiting, check out the code chunk below. The first step is to load the installedpackages.rda file from your root (home) directory into your Environment pane. Then it starts taking action on this vector of package names. See what it does in the next step, the for loop, and think about how it works. - It measures the length of the vector, installedpackages. - Then it counts from 1 to the length of installedpackages. - For each count, it installs the package at position [count] in the vector - Then it goes to the next [count] value, and installs the next package in the vector - Until it reaches the full length of the vector (installs the last package), and then stops. # loads vector into your Environment pane load(&quot;~/installed_packages.rda&quot;) # For each package in this vector of length [count], # install them one by one until the last one is installed. for (count in 1:length(installedpackages)) { install.packages(installedpackages[count]) } When all of the installation is complete, you can check your work by running installed.packages() again in the R Studio console. You should see a full list of your packages, and you are updated and ready to go! 2.2 Install or Update R Studio RStudio is a software (considered an Integrated Development Environment, or IDE) that provides R programmers with an easy-to-use interface for coding in R. Note: RStudio will not work without R installed, and you won’t particularly enjoy using R without having RStudio installed. Be sure to install both! New install: To install RStudio, visit rstudio.com/products/rstudio/. Download the free (“Open Source Edition”) Desktop version for your operating system. Update: If you already have RStudio and need to update: Open RStudio, and under ‘Help’ in the top menu, choose ‘Check for updates.’ If you have the most recent release, it will return ‘No update available. You are running the most recent version of RStudio.’ Otherwise, you should follow the instructions to install an updated version. Open RStudio (logo you’ll click on shown below). If you are prompted to install Command Line Tools, do it. Mac Users There may be a need to install command line tools and XQuartz: To install command line tools (if you’re not automatically prompted), run in the Terminal tab in RStudio: xcode-select --install Visit xquartz.org to download &amp; install XQuartz. 2.2.1 Update R Packages in R Studio You will want to periodically update R packages to ensure you have the most up to date version. You can do this within RStudio by navigating via the Task Bar to Tools/Check for Package Updates. Select All, and let the updates begin. 2.3 Install Quarto This is an optional tool within R Studio that is extremely powerful, but it is not required. Quarto is a scientific publishing tool built on Pandoc that allows R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS users to create dynamic documents, websites, books and more. As of July 2022, Quarto comes pre-installed in R Studio (v2022.07). If you haven’t updated your R Studio IDE (and concerned about doing so), you can install Quarto separately. Download Quarto here and install To use Quarto through the RStudio IDE, be sure to have at least version v2022.02 installed (see directions in step 2, above) Learn more about Quarto here. 2.4 Learn How to Use R &amp; RStudio There are many resources out there to help you learn how to use R and the RStudio IDE (YouTube, Googling, StackOverflow, etc…). This is a short list of primary resources for you to reference. We encourage you to join R community Slack workspaces, R User community groups (such as R-Ladies), and UC Riverside Data Science clubs!

In the RStudio console, run the following: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&#39;rstudio/bookdown&#39;) 3.2.1 Additional packages You may need to install additional packages if you do not currently have them in order to render the Resource Guide bookdown: formatR here kableExtra Rtools shiny tidyverse 3.2.2 Install TinyTex TinyTeX is a custom LaTeX distribution. LaTeX, which is pronounced «Lah-tech» or «Lay-tech», is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for technical or scientific documents. To learn more about TinyTex, navigate to this document, and to learn more about LaTex, visit the LaTex Project site. To install TinyTex on your computer, navigate to the R Studio console panel, and type in the following command: tinytex::install_tinytex() 3.3 Render, Build &amp; Publish the Resource Guide When updates are made to the Resource Guide, it needs to be rendered, built, and then the updates published. In your Console, type either of these commands depending on which type of render you prefer: bookdown::render_book(\"index.Rmd\", \"bookdown::gitbook\") bookdown::render_book(\"index.Rmd\", \"bookdown::pdf_book\") Note: If there is an error during rendering, Google what the error message means! You should be able to find an answer on stack overflow or other tech support site. One of the most common errors during rendering is that not all dependencies (aka packages) have been installed on your local computer. Figure 3.1: An common error message in the RStudio console: Error in library(here): there is no package called here. If you see this library error message, all you need to do is install the required package! The additional warning messages are notifications that R should be updated to be compatiable with the current packages. These will not hender the render. Once you have rendered updates using the console commands above: navigate to the Environment, Connections, Build, Git panel, select the Build tab, select Build Bookdown once the build is complete (the final line should read Output created: docs/index/html), commit, pull and push updates to GitHub via the Git tab. The following information is directly taken from the bookdown package (Xie 2022). 3.4 Formatting You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 3.4.1 Referencing Bookdown Chapters Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., reference this Resource Guide Chapter 1 by using the markdown format: \\@ref(insert chapter label name here). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. 3.4.2 Formatting Figures Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. Figure 3.2: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 3.2. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 3.1. Table 3.1: Here is a nice table!

GitHub lets you (and others) work together on projects. Navigate to github.com, and create an account! Please use either your work or personal email account. You can add several emails to your account, and assign a particular email as the primary email for the account. Review this article on choosing a GitHub username: happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html. Once you have created a GitHub account, join the CCB’s GitHub Organization. Please email the CCB PI to request they invite you to the organization. 4.2 Git Git is a tool utilized for source code management. It tracks changes and updates to code and allows for multiple users to work together within the same repository. Recommended reading for background information on Git and its utility (Yıldırım 2020). Check to see if your computer already has git: Open RStudio In the terminal, run the following command: which git (Mac, Linux) where git (Windows) If git is already installed, the return to the above command should return a filepath similar to: MacOS /usr/local/bin/git Windows C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe If there is no response, download and install git from here: git-scm.com/downloads. Select the default settings within the prompts except the default to master branch. This branch is being phased out, so select the option that let’s you select alternative branches (ex: main). Once Git is installed and your GitHub account has been set up, Git needs to be configured on the computer. Configuring Git is required to push &amp; pull commits to GitHub. Configuring Git: In RStudio, open the terminal. Run the following commands separately, pressing Enter after each line. Replace username and email with your GitHub account username and email. Make sure to keep the quotes around the username in the code below: git config --global user.name \"Jane Doe\" git config --global user.email janedoe@example.com Once you have entered the above command line code, check that the configuration was set correctly. In the RStudio Terminal, type the following command and hit enter: git config --list --global In the terminal, it should show code similar to this in the Terminal: user.name=janedoe user.email=janedoe@ucr.edu core.excludesfile=/Users/janedoe/.gitignore If when installing or updating Git, the default branch was not set to main (it is defaulting to the old master branch), you can change this setting globally. In the Terminal again, enter the line below: git config --global init.defaultBranch main For more information on configuring Git: check out this Git reference 4.3 Personal Access Token Once Git has been configured to commit to your GitHub account, a Personal Access Token (PAT) must be created for each computer you intend to use. A PAT is an alternative password authentication method for Git to access GitHub accounts. In the RStudio Console, install the usethis package in R by running the following code: install.packages(\"usethis\") If the usethis package is installed correctly, at the end of the stream of text there should be a message similar to the image below: Once the usethis package is installed, run the following in the RStudio Console: usethis::create_github_token() Enter your GitHub password when prompted. This should take you to the Settings/Developer settings section of your GitHub account: Note Field Change the PAT name to a meaningful reference (see image for an example). You may end up creating multiple PATs, so you want to ensure that you know which PAT is designated for each computer | server. Expiration Field This is to select a set expiration timeframe for your PAT. Setting an expiration is highly recommended, and GitHub will send you SEVERAL emails prior to it expiring to remind you to renew it. Use the drop down to select a set time frame (7 days to 90 days) or create a custom expiration time frame (exactly a year or particular date). Select Scopes Field Define access for the Personal Access Token being generated. It is recommended to select at least the following scopes: - repo - workflow - write:packages - notifications - delete repo - write:discussions - project To learn more about Scopes, visit the GitHub Scopes for OAUth Apps page. Once Scopes are selected, click on the green Generate token button: Copy the generated PAT to your clipboard. Paste and Save this PAT in a text file in a secure folder that will NEVER be accessed by other users or the internet. You can create a private folder on your personal computer to store these files. Return to RStudio Console and run the following command: gitcreds::gitcreds_set(). You will be prompted to paste the PAT into the console: Paste the PAT at the end of the line Enter password or token: and press enter. In the console, run: usethis::git_sitrep() This command should return your GitHub account information (see example below). For more information on PATs, check out GitHub’s PAT information page.

To install and use the GlobalProtect VPN, navigate to the UCR ServiceLink GlobalProtect Connection Installation Instructions. 5.2 CCB NAS Server The Center for Conservation Biology has a NAS Server, which serves as the primary data storage location to access data and reference files. CCB staff should ensure that all work and research related files are saved on the NAS. Reference Chapter 7 for proper directory organization and file naming. Network-attached storage (NAS) is dedicated file storage that enables multiple users to retrieve data from centralized disk capacity. The purpose of NAS is to enable users to collaborate and share data more effectively. It is especially useful to teams that need remote access. NAS connects to a wireless router, making it easy for remote workers to access files from any device with a network connection. The CCB NAS server model is Synology DS920+. For more information on the unit, see Chapter 8. 5.2.1 Access the CCB NAS Server from Local Computer In order to access the CCB NAS, there just a few steps: Step 01: Request the creation of a NAS user account through the designated CCB staff member. You will need to provide your preferred username (typically similar to UCR ID) and a passcode. The passcode must be a strong code: a unique code with 12 - 15 characters consisting of a mix of letters, numbers, symbols, and does not contain personal information. Step 02: Once a user account has been created, log onto the UCR VPN (see above section). Step 03: Map the server onto your local computer: For PCs running Windows 11: Open File Explorer on Windows 11. Click on This PC from the left pane. Click the See More (three-dotted) button in the command bar and select the “Map network drive” option. Use the Drive drop-down menu and choose a letter to assign the drive. In the Folder field, enter the network path to the shared folder, \\\\CCBNAS.dyn.ucr.edu\\pdo. (Or click the Browse button to browse the folder to map as a network drive, and click the OK button.) Check the Reconnect at sign-in option to make the connection permanent. Check the Connect using different credentials option if the credentials are different from the account you are already using. Click the Finish button. Confirm the network account credentials (if applicable) to map the network drive to Windows 11. Click the OK button. Once you complete the steps, the network drive will become available in File Explorer. If you run into issues, first read over this blog post for a common linkage issue. For PCs running Windows 10: On your Windows 10 PC, open Windows Explorer. Click on This Computer. Click on Map network drive. Select a drive letter from the drop-down menu. Enter \\\\CCBNAS.dyn.ucr.edu\\pdo into the folder field. Click Finish. Enter your Synology NAS username and password in the Windows credentials pop-up prompt. The mapped network drive will now appear within Windows Explorer as local storage, allowing you to quickly transfer files. For Macs: Open the Finder app. Click Go on top bar and select Connect to Server. Type in the CCB NAS IP: smb://CCBNAS.dyn.ucr.edu/pdo Enter User Name and Passcode. There should be a connection set to the CCB NAS at the folder level. 5.2.2 Connecting the CCB NAS Synology to Git The information below was taken from the Synology Knowledge Center. Git is an open-source distributed version control system, which allows you to maintain software source code, documents, or any type of file on a computer with speed and efficiency. 5.2.2.1 To create a Git repository: Sign in to DSM using an account with administrative privileges.

Art Credit: Dr. Allison Horst, UCSB Use hyphens (-) or underscores (_) to separate elements in a file name for documents; Always use the ISO 8601 date format in file names: YYYYMMDD. For example, in the file name 20230131_DTLA_RA.csv January 31, 2023 is represented as 20230131; Preserve the 3-letter file extension for application-specific codes of file format (e.g. .doc, .xls, .mov, .tif); With sequential numbering (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.), use leading zeros to accommodate multi-digit versions. For example, use 01-10 for 1-10, 001-100 for 1-100, and so on; Include versioning of file names where appropriate (ex: filename_rev20230131.doc). Order the elements in a file name in the most appropriate way to retrieve the record. For example, file name with the date, the project name (or acronym) or project location should be first, then the type of data or file (either RA or Report), then version or author, Examples: 20170217_CVStormwaterVAP.csv, 20221231_CVMC_CRCA01_Proposal_LCS.doc 7.2 Folder Organization 7.3 Data Management "],["equipment.html", "Chapter 8 Equipment", " Chapter 8 Equipment Inventory of software and equipment used and references ARC MAP DESKTOP: ArcMap ArcGIS Desktop, version 10.9 (Esri, Redlands, California) LASER RANGEFINDER: Hilti PD-42 laser rangefinder (Hilti Corporation, Schaan, Liechtenstein) TABLETS: Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 2 tablet (Samsung Group, Seoul, South Korea) GPS: Trimble Juno 3 SERVER: NAS model – Synology DS920+ Storage – HUS728T8TALE6L4 Ultrastar DC HC320 8TB (x2, one for backup) OS &amp; Monitoring software – Synology DSM (DiskStation Manager) 7.1-42661 "],["concur.html", "Chapter 9 Concur Travel 9.1 Submitting a Trip Request - Before the trip 9.2 Submitting an Expense Report - After the trip", " Chapter 9 Concur Travel UCR provides reimbursements for travel, lodging, and meals associated with travel for work.

Please remember that, even though the travel application is changing, the UC travel policy is not and the Expense Report in the new Concur Travel system will still require a business purpose and itemized receipts for travel expenses. And, similar to the old iTravel system, the new Concur Travel system will allow only the Traveler to approve a Declaration of Missing Evidence (DME) and only the Traveler can submit an Expense Report. The new Concur Travel system uses a two-step process: 1 - Submitting a Trip Request prior to travelling 2 - Submitting an Expense Report after your trip is complete (Please note that BMPN Travel Arrangers can assist with training for this step) Note You can reach out to the BMPN Travel Arrangers (Sarah Acrey, Jeanette Westbrook, or Elisha Hankins) for assistance in completing your first Expense Report in Concur Travel. Please also note that at this time travel arrangers are not made aware when a trip has been requested or expense report submitted.

All aspects of our professional contributions to the project are discussed and agreed upon together, and all tasks - although they might be led by individual team members - are developed through collaborative practice. Devotion to supporting the team, working as a team player, providing constructive critique to your team members, and respecting the interests of the team as a successful working group (without compromising their safety or security, as described below), are paramount. 10.2 We are committed to prioritizing and championing the people and communities that host us. Our work is driven by local needs, and decision-making is grounded in evidence and robust data gathered in local contexts. We are critically aware of the existing evidence. We attend events and participate in activities that are organised by our host communities. We respect, care for and create long-lasting friendships with our hosts. We aim to abide by local expectations around dress and custom, and if working in communities where the primary language is not our own, we are committed to learning the language. We maintain links with our hosts after the project ends and we support their future professional endeavors. 10.3 We are committed to the working hours, professional expectations and responsibilities defined by the overall project directors. We typically work as part of a larger project team guided by wider goals than ours alone. We are aware of their responsibilities, we have read the necessary guidance documents, we have understood and signed the necessary insurance and risk assessment documentation, and in all cases, we respect and abide by the instructions given by the directors. This includes zero tolerance in relation to behavior that compromises the well being, equality, security or dignity of other human beings, as described below. 10.4 We are representatives and extensions of the University of California, Riverside and its staff, and of the professional bodies to which we and our project leaders are subscribed. We recognize our duty of care to, and our responsibility for professionalism in, not only the communities where we work and reside, but the university and surrounding organisations to which we and our project leaders are accountable. Our behaviors reflect on these institutions and we acknowledge that our direct supervisor is (and therefore we too are) bound by the ethical and professional codes of both UC Riverside and other institutional affiliations. Considering these obligations, you agree with the following: I will come to my direct supervisor the moment that I experience problems, challenges or trouble of any kind. I will keep her informed of any issues that I feel may manifest themselves in relation to myself, my teammates or affiliates while in the field. If I feel I need support beyond my direct supervisor, I will turn to the 2nd identified lead for their advice. I have already disclosed to my direct supervisor any potential matters of concern (which may include matters relating to health, psychological and physical wellbeing, security, equality, confidence, interpersonal relations, previous travel or fieldwork experiences, etc.) so that they are aware of them and can mitigate them prior to departing for - and during - fieldwork. If I have not yet disclosed such matters, I agree to do so as soon as possible. I have shared this information in confidence, with an expectation of complete privacy unless urgent medical, safety, security, or other legal intervention is required. 10.5 We recognize that fieldwork can be intense, emotional and tiring. We understand that things can go wrong, that we may need to compromise, and that in exceptional circumstances, we made need to shorten or modify your work on site to help manage these circumstances. In such cases, we will have a series of conversations about how to deal with difficulties, led by your direct supervisor and/or other lead. If the difficulties are not resolved within 7 days of identification, we will consult with the university for their guidance. If it is agreed with the University that the difficulties are unresolvable in the field, we will help you to organize your safe return home. 10.6 We have the right to a safe, secure and non-threatening working and living environment. We do not tolerate any form of discriminatory, abusive, aggressive, harassing, threatening, sexually- or physically-intimidating, or related problematic behaviors that compromise the wellbeing, equality, security or dignity of other human beings (whether those humans are our peers, colleagues, supervisors, collaborators, local community members or any persons at all). Our supervisors are trained in supporting those who have experienced or are experiencing harassment. They are obliged to investigate and respond to observed, implied or directly reported harassment. Considering this zero-tolerance policy, you agree to the following: I will not engage in behavior that compromises the wellbeing, equality, security or dignity of other human beings. I recognize that if I am implicated in such behavior I will be required to leave the project at my own expense and may be subject to criminal investigation. If I witness others being subjected to such behavior, I will report it immediately to my direct supervisor. If I feel I cannot speak to my direct supervisor, I will report it to the 2nd identified lead. If I feel I cannot report it to either my direct supervisor or the 2nd lead, then I will contact the University of California, Riverside Compliance office. If I myself feel unsafe or uncomfortable, I will report it immediately to my direct supervisor. My supervisor will support me and will implement actions to keep me safe while working to stop the behavior. If I feel I cannot speak to my direct supervisor, I will report it to the 2nd identified lead. If I feel I cannot report it to either my direct supervisor or the 2nd lead, then I will contact the University of California, Riverside Compliance office. My commitment to creating and maintaining safety and security for all extends to my online (web and social media) and mobile phone interactions, and I recognize that the process for reporting and acting on threatening online/mobile phone behaviors is the same as above. 10.7 Important University of California, Riverside Links UCR Values Ethics &amp; Compliance Program Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation Complaint and Resolution Standards of Conduct Environmental Heath &amp; Safety Alcohol and Drug Policy Personal Relationship Policy References "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
