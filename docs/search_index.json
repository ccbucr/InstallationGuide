Team members may contribute to this reference file as we expand the tools utlizied during research efforts. 1.1 Computer requirements Work computers (laptop or desktop) operating systems should either be Windows or macOS. Please note that Windows based machine it required to run ESRI ArcDesktop and ArcPro software. Both Windows and macOS may utilize ESRI ArcOnline tools. For Mac users, update macOS to the newest supported version. Navigate to System Preferences –&gt; Software Update. For PC users, ensure you have Windows 10 or 11 installed. If not, request a Windows key from UCR IT at UC Riverside ServiceLink 1.2 Software Software covered in this reference guide includes: git GitHub Google Apps R RStudio Quarto Bookdown Slack Trello Trello 4 Slack Zotero Thank you to UC Santa Barbara’s Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management and National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) staff for providing many of the resources listed in this reference guide.

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1.

For example, the bookdown package (Xie 2022) in this reference book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). 2.4 Alt Text for Accessibility Use the knitr package to add alt text to graphics in R Markdown files 2.5 Rendering Bookdown to Build &amp; Publish In your Console, type either of these commands depending on which type of render you prefer: bookdown::render_book(\"index.Rmd\", \"bookdown::gitbook\") bookdown::render_book(\"index.Rmd\", \"bookdown::pdf_book\") To compile to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. It is recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/.

For more information, please visit What is R. To install R, visit cloud.r-project.org to download the most recent version for your operating system. 3.2 Install or Update R Studio RStudio is a software (considered an Integrated Development Environment, or IDE) that provides R programmers with an easy-to-use interface for coding in R. Note: RStudio will not work without R installed, and you won’t particularly enjoy using R without having RStudio installed. Be sure to install both! New install: To install RStudio, visit rstudio.com/products/rstudio/. Download the free (“Open Source Edition”) Desktop version for your operating system. Update: If you already have RStudio and need to update: Open RStudio, and under ‘Help’ in the top menu, choose ‘Check for updates.’ If you have the most recent release, it will return ‘No update available. You are running the most recent version of RStudio.’ Otherwise, you should follow the instructions to install an updated version. Open RStudio (logo you’ll click on shown below). If you are prompted to install Command Line Tools, do it. Mac Users There may be a need to install command line tools and XQuartz: To install command line tools (if you’re not automatically prompted), run in the Terminal tab in RStudio: xcode-select --install Visit xquartz.org to download &amp; install XQuartz. 3.3 Install Quarto This is an optional tool within R Studio that is extremely powerful, but not required for your job Quarto is a scientific publishing tool built on Pandoc that allows R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS users to create dynamic documents, websites, books and more. Download Quarto here and install To use Quarto through the RStudio IDE, be sure to have at least version v2022.02 installed (see directions in step 2, above) "],["git.html", "Chapter 4 Git Installation &amp; GitHub Account 4.1 Git 4.2 GitHub", " Chapter 4 Git Installation &amp; GitHub Account 4.1 Git Check to see if your computer already has git: Open RStudio In the terminal, run the following command: which git If git is already installed, the return to the above command should return a filepath (ex: /usr/local/bin/git). If there is no response, download and install git from here: git-scm.com/downloads. Select the default settings within the prompts except the default to master branch. This branch is being phased out, so select the option that let’s you select alternative branches (ex: main). 4.2 GitHub GitHub is a internet based code hosting platform for collaboration and version control. GitHub lets you (and others) work together on projects. Navigate to github.com, and create an account! Please use either your work or personal email account. You can add several emails to your account, and assign a particular email as the primary email for the account. Review this article on choosing a GitHub username: happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html.
