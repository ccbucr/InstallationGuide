For more information, please visit What is R. To install R, visit cloud.r-project.org to download the most recent version for your operating system. 2.2 Install or Update R Studio RStudio is a software (considered an Integrated Development Environment, or IDE) that provides R programmers with an easy-to-use interface for coding in R. Note: RStudio will not work without R installed, and you won’t particularly enjoy using R without having RStudio installed. Be sure to install both! New install: To install RStudio, visit rstudio.com/products/rstudio/. Download the free (“Open Source Edition”) Desktop version for your operating system. Update: If you already have RStudio and need to update: Open RStudio, and under ‘Help’ in the top menu, choose ‘Check for updates.’ If you have the most recent release, it will return ‘No update available. You are running the most recent version of RStudio.’ Otherwise, you should follow the instructions to install an updated version. Open RStudio (logo you’ll click on shown below). If you are prompted to install Command Line Tools, do it. Mac Users There may be a need to install command line tools and XQuartz: To install command line tools (if you’re not automatically prompted), run in the Terminal tab in RStudio: xcode-select --install Visit xquartz.org to download &amp; install XQuartz. 2.3 Install Quarto This is an optional tool within R Studio that is extremely powerful, but it is not required. Quarto is a scientific publishing tool built on Pandoc that allows R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS users to create dynamic documents, websites, books and more. As of July 2022, Quarto comes pre-installed in R Studio (v2022.07). If you haven’t updated your R Studio IDE (and concerned about doing so), you can install Quarto separately. Download Quarto here and install To use Quarto through the RStudio IDE, be sure to have at least version v2022.02 installed (see directions in step 2, above) Learn more about Quarto here. 2.4 Learn How to Use R &amp; RStudio There are many resources out there to help you learn how to use R and the RStudio IDE (YouTube, Googling, StackOverflow, etc…). This is a short list of primary resources for you to reference. We encourage you to join R community Slack workspaces, R User community groups (such as R-Ladies), and UC Riverside Data Science clubs! ACM at UCR - UC Riverside community dedicated to technical, professional, and personal development in the context of computer science.

In the RStudio console, run the following: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&#39;rstudio/bookdown&#39;) 3.3 Render, Build &amp; Publish the Resource Guide When updates are made to the Resource Guide, it needs to be render, built, and then the updates published. In your Console, type either of these commands depending on which type of render you prefer: bookdown::render_book(\"index.Rmd\", \"bookdown::gitbook\") bookdown::render_book(\"index.Rmd\", \"bookdown::pdf_book\") Note: to compile to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. It is recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. Once you have rendered updates using the console commands above: navigate to the Environment, Connections, Build, Git panel, select the Build tab, select Build Bookdown once the build is complete (the final line should read Output created: docs/index/html), commit, pull and push updates to GitHub via the Git tab. The following information is directly taken from the bookdown package (Xie 2022). 3.4 Formatting You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. Figure 3.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 3.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 3.1.

GitHub lets you (and others) work together on projects. Navigate to github.com, and create an account! Please use either your work or personal email account. You can add several emails to your account, and assign a particular email as the primary email for the account. Review this article on choosing a GitHub username: happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html. Once you have created a GitHub account, join the CCB’s GitHub Organization. Please email the CCB PI to request they invite you to the organization. 4.2 Git Git is a tool utilized for source code management. It tracks changes and updates to code and allows for multiple users to work together within the same repository. Recommended reading for background information on Git and its utility (Yıldırım 2020). Check to see if your computer already has git: Open RStudio In the terminal, run the following command: which git If git is already installed, the return to the above command should return a filepath (ex: /usr/local/bin/git). If there is no response, download and install git from here: git-scm.com/downloads. Select the default settings within the prompts except the default to master branch. This branch is being phased out, so select the option that let’s you select alternative branches (ex: main). Once Git is installed and your GitHub account has been set up, Git needs to be configured on the computer. Configuring Git is required to push &amp; pull commits to GitHub. In RStudio, open the terminal. Run the following commands separately, pressing Enter after each line. Replace username and email with your GitHub account username and email. Make sure to keep the quotes around the username in the code below: git config --global user.name \"Jane Doe\" git config --global user.email janedoe@example.com Once you have entered the above command line code, check that the configuration was set correctly. In the RStudio Terminal, type the following command and hit enter: git config --list --global In the terminal, it should show code similar to this in the Terminal: user.name=janedoe user.email=janedoe@ucr.edu core.excludesfile=/Users/janedoe/.gitignore If when installing or updating Git, the default branch was not set to main (it is defaulting to the old master branch), you can change this setting globally. In the Terminal again, enter the line below: git config --global init.defaultBranch main For more information on configuring Git: check out this Git reference 4.3 Personal Access Token Once Git has been configured to commit to your GitHub account, a Personal Access Token (PAT) must be created for each computer you intend to use. A PAT is an alternative password authentication method for Git to access GitHub accounts. In the RStudio Console, install the usethis package in R by running the following code: install.packages(\"usethis\") If the usethis package is installed correctly, at the end of the stream of text there should be a message similar to the image below: Once the usethis package is installed, run the following in the RStudio Console: usethis::create_github_token() Enter your GitHub password when prompted. This should take you to the Settings/Developer settings section of your GitHub account: Note Field Change the PAT name to a meaningful reference (see image for an example). You may end up creating multiple PATs, so you want to ensure that you know which PAT is designated for each computer | server. Expiration Field This is to select a set expiration timeframe for your PAT. Setting an expiration is highly recommended, and GitHub will send you SEVERAL emails prior to it expiring to remind you to renew it. Use the drop down to select a set time frame (7 days to 90 days) or create a custom expiration time frame (exactly a year or particular date). Select Scopes Field Define access for the Personal Access Token being generated. It is recommended to select at least the following scopes: - repo - workflow - write:packages - notifications - delete repo - write:discussions - project To learn more about Scopes, visit the GitHub Scopes for OAUth Apps page. Once Scopes are selected, click on the green Generate token button: Copy the generated PAT to your clipboard. Paste and Save this PAT in a text file in a secure folder that will NEVER be accessed by other users or the internet. You can create a private folder on your personal computer to store these files. Return to RStudio Console and run the following command: gitcreds::gitcreds_set(). You will be prompted to paste the PAT into the console: Paste the PAT at the end of the line Enter password or token: and press enter. In the console, run: usethis::git_sitrep() This command should return your GitHub account information (see example below). For more information on PATs, check out GitHub’s PAT information page.

For example, in the file name DTLA_RA_20230131.csv January 31, 2023 is represented as 20230131; Preserve the 3-letter file extension for application-specific codes of file format (e.g. .doc, .xls, .mov, .tif); With sequential numbering (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.), use leading zeros to accommodate multi-digit versions. For example, use 01-10 for 1-10, 001-100 for 1-100, and so on; Include versioning of file names where appropriate (ex: filename_rev20230131.doc). Order the elements in a file name in the most appropriate way to retrieve the record. For example, the project name (or acronym) or project location should be first, then the type of data or file (either RA or Report), then version or author, end file name with the date, Examples: CVStormwaterVAP20170217.csv, CVMC_CRCA01_Proposal_LCS_20221231.doc; 7.2 Folder Organization 7.3 Data Management "],["codeofconduct.html", "Chapter 8 Code of Conduct 8.1 We are committed to working as a team. 8.2 We are committed to prioritizing and championing the people and communities that host us. 8.3 We are committed to the working hours, professional expectations and responsibilities defined by the overall project directors. 8.4 We are representatives and extensions of the University of California, Riverside and its staff, and of the professional bodies to which we and our project leaders are subscribed. 8.5 We recognize that fieldwork can be intense, emotional and tiring. 8.6 We have the right to a safe, secure and non-threatening working and living environment. 8.7 Important University of California, Riverside Links", " Chapter 8 Code of Conduct The Center of Conservation Biology’s Code of Conduct adapted from (Perry 2018) 8.1 We are committed to working as a team. All aspects of our professional contributions to the project are discussed and agreed upon together, and all tasks - although they might be led by individual team members - are developed through collaborative practice. Devotion to supporting the team, working as a team player, providing constructive critique to your team members, and respecting the interests of the team as a successful working group (without compromising their safety or security, as described below), are paramount. 8.2 We are committed to prioritizing and championing the people and communities that host us. Our work is driven by local needs, and decision-making is grounded in evidence and robust data gathered in local contexts. We are critically aware of the existing evidence. We attend events and participate in activities that are organised by our host communities. We respect, care for and create long-lasting friendships with our hosts. We aim to abide by local expectations around dress and custom, and if working in communities where the primary language is not our own, we are committed to learning the language. We maintain links with our hosts after the project ends and we support their future professional endeavors. 8.3 We are committed to the working hours, professional expectations and responsibilities defined by the overall project directors. We typically work as part of a larger project team guided by wider goals than ours alone. We are aware of their responsibilities, we have read the necessary guidance documents, we have understood and signed the necessary insurance and risk assessment documentation, and in all cases, we respect and abide by the instructions given by the directors. This includes zero tolerance in relation to behavior that compromises the well being, equality, security or dignity of other human beings, as described below. 8.4 We are representatives and extensions of the University of California, Riverside and its staff, and of the professional bodies to which we and our project leaders are subscribed. We recognize our duty of care to, and our responsibility for professionalism in, not only the communities where we work and reside, but the university and surrounding organisations to which we and our project leaders are accountable. Our behaviors reflect on these institutions and we acknowledge that our direct supervisor is (and therefore we too are) bound by the ethical and professional codes of both UC Riverside and other institutional affiliations. Considering these obligations, you agree with the following: I will come to my direct supervisor the moment that I experience problems, challenges or trouble of any kind. I will keep her informed of any issues that I feel may manifest themselves in relation to myself, my teammates or affiliates while in the field. If I feel I need support beyond my direct supervisor, I will turn to the 2nd identified lead for their advice. I have already disclosed to my direct supervisor any potential matters of concern (which may include matters relating to health, psychological and physical wellbeing, security, equality, confidence, interpersonal relations, previous travel or fieldwork experiences, etc.) so that they are aware of them and can mitigate them prior to departing for - and during - fieldwork. If I have not yet disclosed such matters, I agree to do so as soon as possible. I have shared this information in confidence, with an expectation of complete privacy unless urgent medical, safety, security, or other legal intervention is required. 8.5 We recognize that fieldwork can be intense, emotional and tiring. We understand that things can go wrong, that we may need to compromise, and that in exceptional circumstances, we made need to shorten or modify your work on site to help manage these circumstances. In such cases, we will have a series of conversations about how to deal with difficulties, led by your direct supervisor and/or other lead. If the difficulties are not resolved within 7 days of identification, we will consult with the university for their guidance. If it is agreed with the University that the difficulties are unresolvable in the field, we will help you to organize your safe return home. 8.6 We have the right to a safe, secure and non-threatening working and living environment. We do not tolerate any form of discriminatory, abusive, aggressive, harassing, threatening, sexually- or physically-intimidating, or related problematic behaviors that compromise the wellbeing, equality, security or dignity of other human beings (whether those humans are our peers, colleagues, supervisors, collaborators, local community members or any persons at all). Our supervisors are trained in supporting those who have experienced or are experiencing harassment. They are obliged to investigate and respond to observed, implied or directly reported harassment. Considering this zero-tolerance policy, you agree to the following: I will not engage in behavior that compromises the wellbeing, equality, security or dignity of other human beings. I recognize that if I am implicated in such behavior I will be required to leave the project at my own expense and may be subject to criminal investigation. If I witness others being subjected to such behavior, I will report it immediately to my direct supervisor. If I feel I cannot speak to my direct supervisor, I will report it to the 2nd identified lead. If I feel I cannot report it to either my direct supervisor or the 2nd lead, then I will contact the University of California, Riverside Compliance office. If I myself feel unsafe or uncomfortable, I will report it immediately to my direct supervisor. My supervisor will support me and will implement actions to keep me safe while working to stop the behavior. If I feel I cannot speak to my direct supervisor, I will report it to the 2nd identified lead. If I feel I cannot report it to either my direct supervisor or the 2nd lead, then I will contact the University of California, Riverside Compliance office. My commitment to creating and maintaining safety and security for all extends to my online (web and social media) and mobile phone interactions, and I recognize that the process for reporting and acting on threatening online/mobile phone behaviors is the same as above. 8.7 Important University of California, Riverside Links UCR Values Ethics &amp; Compliance Program Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation Complaint and Resolution Standards of Conduct Environmental Heath &amp; Safety Alcohol and Drug Policy Personal Relationship Policy References "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
