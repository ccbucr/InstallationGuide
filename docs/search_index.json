Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, the bookdown package (Xie 2022) in this reference book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). 2.4 Alt Text for Accessibility Use the knitr package to add alt text to graphics in R Markdown files 2.5 Rendering Bookdown to Build &amp; Publish In your Console, type either of these commands depending on which type of render you prefer: bookdown::render_book(\"index.Rmd\", \"bookdown::gitbook\") bookdown::render_book(\"index.Rmd\", \"bookdown::pdf_book\") To compile to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. It is recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/.
