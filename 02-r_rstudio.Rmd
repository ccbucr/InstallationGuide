# R and RStudio Installation {#r}

## Install or Update R 

**R** is a programming language and environment used for statistical computing and grahics. For more information, please visit [What is R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html).

To install R, visit [cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org/) to download the most recent version for your operating system.

## Install or Update R Studio

RStudio is a software (considered an Integrated  Development Environment, or IDE) that provides R programmers with an easy-to-use interface for coding in R. 

**Note:** RStudio will not work without R installed, and you won’t particularly enjoy using R without having RStudio installed. Be sure to install both!

- **New install:** To install RStudio, visit [rstudio.com/products/rstudio/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). Download the free (“Open Source Edition”) Desktop version for your operating system. 

- **Update:** If you already have RStudio and need to update: Open RStudio, and under ‘Help’ in the top menu, choose ‘Check for updates.’ If you have the most recent release, it will return ‘No update available. You are running the most recent version of RStudio.’ Otherwise, you should follow the instructions to install an updated version.

Open RStudio (logo you’ll click on shown below). **If you are prompted to install Command Line Tools, do it.**

```{r rstudio, auto_pdf = TRUE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 6, fig.alt="Image of R Studio logo, which is a white captial R encased in a light blue circle."}

```


**Mac Users**

There may be a need to install command line tools and [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/):

- To install command line tools (if you’re not automatically prompted), run in the Terminal tab in RStudio: `xcode-select --install`

- Visit [xquartz.org](https://www.xquartz.org/) to download & install XQuartz.

## Install Quarto

*This is an optional tool within R Studio that is extremely powerful, but it is not required.*

Quarto is a scientific publishing tool built on Pandoc that allows R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS users to create dynamic documents, websites, books and more.

As of *July 2022*, Quarto comes pre-installed in R Studio (v2022.07). If you haven't updated your R Studio IDE (and concerned about doing so), you can install Quarto separately. 

- Download Quarto [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) and install

- To use Quarto through the RStudio IDE, be sure to have at least version v2022.02 installed (see directions in step 2, above)

Learn more about Quarto [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html).

## Learn How to Use R & RStudio

There are many resources out there to help you learn how to use R and the RStudio IDE (YouTube, Googling, [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), etc...). This is a short list of primary resources for you to reference. We encourage you to join R community Slack workspaces, R User community groups (such as [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/)), and UC Riverside Data Science clubs!
