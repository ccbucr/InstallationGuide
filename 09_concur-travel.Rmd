# Concur Travel {#concur}

UCR provides reimbursements for travel, lodging, and meals associated with travel for work. All travel must be discussed and approved by the PI (Lynn Sweet)


The new Concur Travel system has a modern, mobile-friendly user interface with built-in business rules to check for completeness prior to submitting an Expense Report.  Please remember that, even though the travel application is changing, the UC travel policy is not and the Expense Report in the new Concur Travel system will still require a business purpose and itemized receipts for travel expenses.  And, similar to the old iTravel system, the new Concur Travel system will allow only the Traveler to approve a Declaration of Missing Evidence (DME) and *only* the Traveler can submit an Expense Report. 


The new Concur Travel system uses a two-step process:

1 - Submitting a Trip Request prior to travelling

2 - Submitting an Expense Report after your trip is complete (Please note that BMPN Travel Arrangers can assist with training for this step)

*Note* You can reach out to the BMPN Travel Arrangers (Sarah Acrey, Jeanette Westbrook, or Elisha Hankins) for assistance in completing your first Expense Report in Concur Travel.  Please also note that at this time travel arrangers are not made aware when a trip has been requested or expense report submitted. While campus works to create a report, I ask that you please send a quick email to BMPNPurchasing@ucr.edu to notify us that you have a travel pending review to prevent delays in processing.
