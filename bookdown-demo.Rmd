# R and RStudio Installation {#r}

## Install or Update R 

**R** is a programming language and environment used for statistical computing and grahics. For more information, please visit [What is R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html).

To install R, visit [cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org/) to download the most recent version for your operating system.

## Install or Update R Studio

RStudio is a software (considered an Integrated  Development Environment, or IDE) that provides R programmers with an easy-to-use interface for coding in R. 

**Note:** RStudio will not work without R installed, and you won’t particularly enjoy using R without having RStudio installed. Be sure to install both!

- **New install:** To install RStudio, visit [rstudio.com/products/rstudio/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). Download the free (“Open Source Edition”) Desktop version for your operating system. 

- **Update:** If you already have RStudio and need to update: Open RStudio, and under ‘Help’ in the top menu, choose ‘Check for updates.’ If you have the most recent release, it will return ‘No update available. You are running the most recent version of RStudio.’ Otherwise, you should follow the instructions to install an updated version.

Open RStudio (logo you’ll click on shown below). **If you are prompted to install Command Line Tools, do it.**

```{r rstudio, auto_pdf = TRUE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 6, fig.alt="Image of R Studio logo, which is a white captial R encased in a light blue circle."}

knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio.png")
```


**Mac Users**

There may be a need to install command line tools and [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/):

- To install command line tools (if you’re not automatically prompted), run in the Terminal tab in RStudio: `xcode-select --install`

- Visit [xquartz.org](https://www.xquartz.org/) to download & install XQuartz.

## Install Quarto

*This is an optional tool within R Studio that is extremely powerful, but it is not required.*

Quarto is a scientific publishing tool built on Pandoc that allows R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS users to create dynamic documents, websites, books and more.

As of *July 2022*, Quarto comes pre-installed in R Studio (v2022.07). If you haven't updated your R Studio IDE (and concerned about doing so), you can install Quarto separately. 

- Download Quarto [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) and install

- To use Quarto through the RStudio IDE, be sure to have at least version v2022.02 installed (see directions in step 2, above)

Learn more about Quarto [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html).

## Learn How to Use R & RStudio

There are a lot of resources out there to help you learn how to use R and the RStudio IDE (YouTube, Googling, [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), etc...). This is a short list of primary resources for you to reference.

# Bookdown Guide {#bookdown}

The first step to edit and add to this bookdown is to install the **bookdown** package from CRAN or Github. In the RStudio console, run the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

## Primary Reference Resources

Here is a list of resources to learn how to use and edit in bookdown

- [Bookdown Package Documentation](https://bookdown.org/)
- [Authoring Books with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)
- [R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)
- [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

__________________________________________________________________________________

**The following information is directly taken from the _bookdown_ package** [@R-bookdown].

## Formatting

You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and **a chapter** is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods).

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

## Citations

You can easily write citations using .bib files within this repository formatted using [BibTEX](http://www.bibtex.org/). For example, the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this reference book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].

## Alt Text for Accessibility

[Use the knitr package to add alt text to graphics in R Markdown files](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/knitr-fig-alt/)

## Rendering Bookdown to Build & Publish

In your Console, type either of these commands depending on which type of render you prefer:

`bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::gitbook")`
`bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::pdf_book")`

To compile to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. It is recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.name/tinytex/>.

<!--chapter:end:03-bookdownGuide.Rmd-->

# Git Installation & GitHub Account {#git}

## Git

Check to see if your computer already has git:

- Open RStudio
- In the terminal, run the following command:

`which git`

If `git` is already installed, the return to the above command should return a filepath (ex: `/usr/local/bin/git`). 

- If there is no response, download and install `git` from here: [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Select the default settings within the prompts **except** the default to **master** branch. This branch is being phased out, so select the option that let's you select alternative branches (ex: main).

## GitHub

GitHub is a internet based code hosting platform for collaboration and [version control](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control#:~:text=Version%20control%2C%20also%20known%20as,to%20source%20code%20over%20time.). GitHub lets you (and others) work together on projects.

Navigate to [github.com](https://github.com/), and create an account! Please use either your work or personal email account. You can add several emails to your account, and assign a particular email as the primary email for the account. 

Review this article on choosing a GitHub username: [happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html](happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html). 

Once you have created a GitHub account, join the [CCB's GitHub Organization](https://github.com/ccbucr). Please email the CCB PI to request they invite you to the organization. 

## Configure Git 

Once Git is installed and your GitHub account has been set up, Git needs to be configured on the computer. Configuring Git is required to push & pull commits to GitHub. 

- In RStudio, open the terminal. 
- Run the following commands separately, pressing `Enter` after each line. Replace username and email with your GitHub account username and email. Make sure to keep the quotes around the username in the code below: 

  - `git config --global user.name "Jane Doe"`
  - `git config --global user.email janedoe@example.com`
  
- Once you have entered the above command line code, check that the configuration was set correctly. In the RStudio Terminal, type the following command and hit enter:
  - `git config --list --global`
  
In the terminal, it should show code similar to this in the Terminal:

`user.name=janedoe`
`user.email=janedoe@ucr.edu`
`core.excludesfile=/Users/janedoe/.gitignore`

If when installing or updating Git, the default branch was not set to `main` (it is defaulting to the old `master` branch), you can change this setting globally. In the Terminal again, enter the line below:

`git config --global init.defaultBranch main`

For more information on configuring Git: [check out this Git reference](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

## Personal Access Token

Once Git has been configured to commit to your GitHub account, a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** must be created for **each computer you intend to use**. A PAT is an alternative password authentication method for Git to access GitHub accounts.

- In the RStudio Console, install the [`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) package in R by running the following code:

`install.packages("usethis")` 

If the `usethis` package is installed correctly, at the end of the stream of text there should be a message similar to the image below:

```{r usethis, echo = F, auto_pdf = TRUE, fig.align = 'left', fig.height = 3, fig.alt="Installation download message in RStudio console that reads The downloaded binary packages are in this file path."}

knitr::include_graphics("images/usethis.png")
```

- Once the `usethis` package is installed, run the following in the RStudio Console:

`usethis::create_github_token()`

  - Enter your GitHub password when prompted. 
  
This should take you to the **Settings/Developer settings** section of your GitHub account:

```{r pat, echo = F, auto_pdf = TRUE, fig.align = 'left', fig.height = 3, fig.alt="Image of GitHub settings webpage."}

knitr::include_graphics("images/pat.png")
```

- **Note Field**

Change the PAT name to a meaningful reference (see image for an example). You may end up creating multiple PATs, so you want to ensure that you know which PAT is designated for each computer | server. 

- **Expiration Field**

This is to select a set expiration timeframe for your PAT. Setting an expiration is highly recommended, and GitHub will send you *SEVERAL* emails prior to it expiring to remind you to renew it. Use the drop down to select a set time frame (7 days to 90 days) or create a custom expiration time frame (exactly a year or particular date).

- **Select Scopes Field**

Define access for the Personal Access Token being generated. 

It is recommended to select at least the following scopes:
  - repo
  - workflow
  - write:packages
  - notifications
  - delete repo
  - write:discussions
  - project

To learn more about Scopes, visit [the GitHub Scopes for OAUth Apps page](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps).

- Once Scopes are selected, click on the green `Generate token` button: 

```{r generatepat, echo = F, auto_pdf = TRUE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 3}

knitr::include_graphics("images/generatepat.png")
```

   - Copy the generated PAT to your clipboard.
   - Paste and Save this PAT in a text file in a secure folder that will NEVER be accessed by other users or the internet. You can create a `private` folder on your personal computer to store these files. 

- Return to RStudio Console and run the following command:

`gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`.

You will be prompted to paste the PAT into the console:

```{r pastepat, echo = F, auto_pdf = TRUE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 3}

knitr::include_graphics("images/paste_pat.png")
```

Paste the PAT at the end of the line `Enter password or token:` and press enter.

- In the console, run:

`usethis::git_sitrep()`

This command should return your GitHub account information (see example below).


```{r gitsitrep, echo = F, auto_pdf = TRUE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 3}

knitr::include_graphics("images/gitsitrep.png")
```

For more information on PATs, check out [GitHub's PAT information page](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

- ESRI ArcGIS Online: This is cloud-based software that runs on any device with an internet connection. It allows users to easily publish maps on-line, access other UCR spatial products, and create spatial data dashboards and hubs. Check out [UCR ArcGIS Online](https://ucr.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html).

# File Directory Organization {#organization}

## File Naming

When creating file names, best practices dictate that you should:

- Create meaningful but brief names;
- Use file names to classify types of files (ex: DTLA_RA_20230131.csv);
- Avoid using spaces, dots and special characters (& or ? or !);
- Use capital letters to delimit words, not spaces or underscores for data files, *as much as possible* (ex: CVStormwaterMasterVAP20170217.csv);
- Use hyphens (-) or underscores (_) to separate elements in a file name for documents;
- Always use the [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) date format in file names: **YYYYMMDD**. For example, in the file name *DTLA_RA_20230131.csv* January 31, 2023 is represented as **20230131**;
- Preserve the 3-letter file extension for application-specific codes of file format (e.g. .doc, .xls, .mov, .tif);
- With sequential numbering (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.), use leading zeros to accommodate multi-digit versions. For example, use 01-10 for 1-10, 001-100 for 1-100, and so on;
- Order the elements in a file name in the most appropriate way to retrieve the record. For example, 
  - the project name (or acronym) or project location should be first, 
  - then the type of data or file (either RA or Report),
  - then version or author,
  - end file name with the date,
  - Examples: *CVStormwaterVAP20170217.csv*, *CVMC_CRCA01_Proposal_LCS_20221231.doc*;
- Include versioning of file names where appropriate (ex: filename_rev20230131.doc).
